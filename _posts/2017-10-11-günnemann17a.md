abstract: This paper addresses for the first time the problem of engines’ damage prediction
  using huge amounts of imbalanced data from  "structure borne noise" signals related
  to the internal engine excitation. We propose the usage of a convolutional neural
  network on our temporal input signals, subsequently combined with additional static
  features. Using informative mini batches during training we take the imbalance of
  the data into account. The experimental results indicate good performance in detecting
  the minority class on our large real-world use case.
