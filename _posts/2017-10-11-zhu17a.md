abstract: Dealing with class imbalance is a challenging issue in churn prediction.
  Although resampling-based ensemble solutions have demonstrated their superiority
  in many fields, previous research shows that they cannot improve the profit-based
  measure in churn prediction. In this paper, we explore the impact of  the class
  ratio in the training subsets on the predictive performance of resampling-based
  ensemble techniques based on experiments on real-world churn prediction data sets.
  The experimental results show that the setting of the class ratio has a great impact
  on the model performance. It is also found that by choosing suitable class ratios
  in the training subsets, UnderBagging and Balanced Random Forests can significantly
  improve profits brought by the churn prediction model.  The demonstrated results
  provide some guidelines for both academic and industrial practitioners.
