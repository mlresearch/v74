abstract: Domain adaptation is the task of transforming a model trained using data
  from a source domain to a different target domain. In Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
  (UDA), we do not assume any labelled training data from the target domain. In this
  paper, we consider the problem of UDA in the contact of Part-of-Speech (POS).  Specifically,
  we study the effect of data imbalance on UDA of POS, and compare different pivot
  selection strategies for accurately adapting a POS tagger trained using some source
  domain data to a target domain. We propose the use of F-score to select pivots using
  available labelled data in the source domain.  Our experimental results on using
  benchmark dataset for cross-domain POS tagging, show that using frequency combined
  with F-scores for selecting pivots in the source labelled data produces the best
  results.
