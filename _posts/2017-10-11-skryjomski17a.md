abstract: Despite more than two decades of intense research, learning from imbalanced
  data still remains as one of the major difficulties posed for computational intelligence
  systems. Among plethora of techniques dedicated to alleviating this problem, preprocessing
  algorithms are considered among the most efficient ones. They aim at re-balancing
  the training set by either undersampling of the majority class, or oversampling
  of the minority one. Here, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, commonly known
  as SMOTE, stands as the most popular solution that introduces artificial instances
  on the basis of minority class neighborhood distribution. However, many recent works
  point out to the fact that the imbalanced ratio itself is not the sole source of
  learning difficulties in such scenarios. One should take a deeper look into the
  minority class structure in order to identify which instances influence the performance
  of classifiers in most significant manner. In this paper, we propose to investigate
  the role of minority class instance types on the performance of SMOTE. To achieve
  this, instead of oversampling uniformly the minority class, we preprocess only selected
  subsets of instances, based on their individual difficulties. Experimental study
  proves that such a selective oversampling leads to improved classification performance.
