abstract: Ensemble methods are well known for providing an advantage over single models
  in a large range of data mining and machine learning tasks. Their benefits are commonly
  associated to the ability of reducing the bias and/or variance in learning tasks.
  Ensembles have been studied both for classification and regression tasks with uniform
  domain preferences. However, only for imbalanced classification these methods were
  thoroughly studied. In this paper we present an empirical study concerning the predictive
  ability of ensemble methods bagging and boosting in regression tasks, using 20 data
  sets with imbalanced distributions, and assuming non-uniform domain preferences.
  Results show that ensemble methods are capable of providing improvements in predictive
  ability towards under-represented values, and that this improvement influences the
  predictive ability of models concerning the average behaviour of the data. Results
  also show that the smaller data sets are prone to larger improvements in predictive
  accuracy and that no conclusion could be drawn when considering the percentage of
  rare cases alone.
