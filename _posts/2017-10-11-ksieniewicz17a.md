abstract: Recently, the problem of imbalanced data is the focus of intense research
  of machine learning community. Following work tries to utilize an approach of transforming
  the data space into another where classification task may become easier. Paper contains
  a proposition of a tool, based on a photographic metaphor to build a classifier
  ensemble, combined with a random subspace approach. Developed solution is insensitive
  to a sample size and robust to dimension increase, which allows a regularization
  of feature space, reducing the impact of biased classes. The proposed approach was
  evaluated on the basis of the computer experiments carried out on the benchmark
  and synthetic datasets.
