abstract: Multi-label classification deals with problems where each datapoint can
  be assigned to more than one class, or label, at the same time. The simplest approach
  for such problems is to train independent binary classification models for each
  label and use these models to independently predict a set of relevant labels for
  a datapoint. MLkNN is an instance-based lazy learning algorithm for multi-label
  classification that takes this approach. MLkNN, and similar algorithms, however,
  do not exploit associations which may exist between the set of potential labels.
  These methods also suffer from imbalance in the frequency of labels in a training
  dataset. This work attempts to improve the predictions of MLkNN by implementing
  a two-layer stack-like method, Stacked-MLkNN which exploits the label associations.
  Experiments show that Stacked-MLkNN produces better predictions than MLkNN and several
  other state-of-the-art instance-based learning algorithms.
