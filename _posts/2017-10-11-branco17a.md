abstract: The problem of imbalanced domains, framed within predictive tasks, is relevant
  in many practical applications. When dealing with imbalanced domains a performance
  degradation is usually observed on the most rare and relevant cases for the user.
  This problem has been thoroughly studied within a classification setting where the
  target variable is nominal. The exploration of this problem in other contexts is
  more recent within the research community. For regression tasks, where the target
  variable is continuous, only a few solutions exist. Pre-processing strategies are
  among the most successful proposals for tackling this problem. In this paper we
  propose a new pre-processing approach for dealing with imbalanced regression. Our
  algorithm, SMOGN, incorporates two existing proposals trying to solve problems detected
  in both of them. We show that SMOGN has advantages in comparison to other approaches.
  We also show that our method has a different impact on the learners used, displaying
  more advantages for Random Forest and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines learners.
