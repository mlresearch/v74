abstract: This paper presents an evaluation of three different anomaly detector methods
  over different feature sets.  The three anomaly detectors are based respectively
  on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), One-Class SVM and isolation Forest. The considered
  feature sets are built from personality evaluation and audio signal. Personality
  evaluations are extracted from the BFI-10 Questionnaire, which allows to manually
  evaluate five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness,
  Neuroticism).  From the audio signal, we automatically extract a prosodic feature
  set, which performs well in affective computing. The different combinations of models
  and feature sets are evaluated on the SSPNET-Personality corpus which has already
  been used in several experiments, including a previous work on separating two types
  of personality profiles in a supervised way. In this work, we propose an evaluation
  of the three anomaly detectors with consideration to the features used. Results
  show that, regardless of the feature set, GMM based method is the most efficient
  one (it obtains 0.96 ROC-AUC score with the best feature set). The prosodic feature
  set seems to be a good compromise between performance (0.91 ROC-AUC score with GMM
  based method) and ease of extraction.
