abstract: Classifiers have difficulty recognizing under-represented minorities in
  imbalanced datasets, due to their focus on minimizing the overall misclassification
  error. This introduces predictive biases against minority classes. Post-processing
  plug-in rules are popular for tackling class imbalance, but they often affect the
  certainty of base classifier posteriors, when the latter already perform correct
  classification. This shortcoming makes them ill-suited to scoring tasks, where informative
  posterior scores are required for human interpretation. To this end, we propose
  the $ILoss$ metric to measure the impact of imbalance-aware classifiers on the certainty
  of posterior distributions. We then generalize post-processing plug-in rules in
  an easily tunable framework and theoretically show that this framework tends to
  improve performance balance. Finally, we experimentally assert that appropriate
  usage of our framework can reduce $ILoss$ while yielding similar performance, with
  respect to common imbalance-aware measures, to existing plug-in rules for binary
  problems.
