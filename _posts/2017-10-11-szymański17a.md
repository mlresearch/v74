abstract: 'We present a new approach to stratifying multi-label data for classification
  purposes based on the iterative stratification approach proposed by Sechidis et.
  al. in an ECML PKDD 2011 paper. Our method extends the iterative approach to take
  into account second-order relationships between labels. Obtained results are evaluated
  using statistical properties of obtained strata as presented by Sechidis. We also
  propose new statistical measures relevant to second-order quality: label pairs distribution,
  the percentage of label pairs without positive evidence in folds and label pair
  - fold pairs that have no positive evidence for the label pair. We verify the impact
  of new methods on classification performance of Binary Relevance, Label Powerset
  and a fast greedy community detection based label space partitioning classifier.
  The proposed approach lowers the variance of classification quality, improves label
  pair oriented measures and example distribution while maintaining a competitive
  quality in label-oriented measures. We also witness an increase in stability of
  network characteristics.'
