abstract: When faced with imbalanced domains, practitioners have one of two choices;
  if the imbalance is manageable, sampling or other corrective measures can be utilized
  in conjunction with binary classifiers (BCs). Beyond a certain point, however, the
  imbalance becomes too extreme and one-class classifiers (OCCs) are required. Whilst
  the literature offers many advances in terms of algorithms and understanding, there
  remains a need to connect our theoretical advances to the most practical of decisions.
  Specifically, given a dataset with some level of complexity and imbalance, which
  classification approach should be applied? In this paper, we establish a relationship
  between these facets in order to help guide the decision regarding when to apply
  OCC versus BC. Our results show that sampling provides an edge over OCCs on complex
  domains. Alternatively, OCCs are a good choice on less complex domains that exhibit
  unimodal properties. Class overlap, on the other hand, has a more uniform impact
  across all methods.
